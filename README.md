Buildscript
-----------
This repository contains build scripts for Gluon with Freifunk Flensburg configuration
makeallbs.sh was the first buildscript (doesn't work anymore)
makeallexp.sh creates gluon with current experimental configuration
makeallstable.sh creates the upcoming stable Gluon Version
These scripts work in gluon base directory and are created to build all targets at once.

have fun
